# Project_R
Introducing Project_R (Temporary Name): Immerse yourself in the thrilling world of top-down tank warfare! Inspired by the historical significance of World War 2 tanks and the dynamic taking-damage mechanic of games like War Thunder, Project_R promises an exhilarating gaming experience.


Why top-down?
-> Given my current skill set and experience in game development, I am primarily familiar with 2D platformers and top-down games. Therefore, I faced a choice when deciding on the direction for my next project. Additionally, I stumbled upon an incredible sprite sheet featuring World War 2 Tanks on itch.io (credit to the creator), specifically designed for top-down art. Considering my prior experience with top-down game development and the availability of this fantastic sprite sheet, I opted to pursue this direction for my new project. This choice not only aligns with my skill set but also provides access to high-quality assets that will enhance the visual appeal of the game.

Why tanks?
-> Tanks have always held a special place in my heart; I've been captivated by these machines for as long as I can remember. My journey with tank-centric games began back in 2014 with my introduction to World of Tanks Blitz, a mobile game by Wargaming. Since then, my passion for tank warfare has only deepened. In 2021, I made the switch to War Thunder, developed by Gaijin, and I've been immersed in its world ever since. Even in games where roles are diverse, my affinity for tanks remains unwaveringâ€”I consistently gravitate towards tank roles or tank heroes. My dedication to these games stems from a genuine fascination with the history, mechanics, and strategic elements that define tank combat.
